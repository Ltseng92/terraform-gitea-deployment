Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
PS C:\Users\User\desktop\terrform-gitea> terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
